# ALX Backend JavaScript

Welcome to the ALX Backend JavaScript repository! This repository contains all the code, projects, and exercises for the backend JavaScript track of the ALX Software Engineering program.

## Overview

This course focuses on the fundamentals of JavaScript, particularly the features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and how they are applied in backend development. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of modern JavaScript concepts, best practices, and how to apply them in real-world backend applications.

## Topics Covered

1. **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)**: Introduction to the latest features of JavaScript.
2. **Statements and Declarations**: Understanding `let`, `const`, and block-scoped variables.
3. **Arrow Functions**: Simplified syntax and their use in functional programming.
4. **Default Parameters**: Setting default values for function parameters.
5. **Rest and Spread Parameters**: Handling multiple function parameters and spreading arrays.
6. **String Templating**: Using template literals for string interpolation.
7. **Object Creation and Properties**: Enhancements in object literals and property handling.
8. **Iterators and For-Of Loops**: Iterating over collections using the `for-of` loop.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have a basic understanding of:

- JavaScript fundamentals
- Node.js and npm
- Completion of the foundational training in the ALX Software Engineering program

## Setup

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Install NodeJS 12.11.x**:
    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo apt install nodejs -y
    ```
    Verify the installation:
    ```bash
    nodejs -v
    npm -v
    ```

2. **Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint**:
    In your project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configuration Files**:
    Ensure you have the following configuration files in your project directory:
    - `package.json`: Manages dependencies and scripts.
    - `babel.config.js`: Babel configuration for transpiling ES6 code.
    - `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for code quality and style.

## Running the Code

To execute your code and run tests, use the following commands:

- **Run Tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

- **Lint Code**:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
